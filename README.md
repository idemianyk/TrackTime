# TrackTime
  C++ (CLR) Program that tracks time of software working on your computer. I made this as my final project for 5th semester.
  The interface is in Ukranian language.
  There are such features in this program:
  - you can kill process in it by clicking at the name of the process and then pressing "Завершити процес" button.
  - you can open report of all ran process and their runtime by pressing .
  - you can save report by pressing 'Файл' and then "Збрегти звіт"
  - you can load report by pressing 'Файл' and then "Відкрити звіт"
  - you can choose default directory for saving reports
